Questions Kernel System Calls (20 Points) We've discussed in class about the Linux kernel - the main component of a Linux OS which functions as the core interface between a computer\u2019s hardware and its processes. But how does it work exactly? what exact commands (or system calls ) do we pass to the kernel from programs such as ls or chmod (or any other program)? The goal of this question is to help you become familiar with the strace command. strace is a Linux command, which traces system calls and signals of a program. It is an important tool to debug your programs in advanced cases. In this assignment, you should follow the strace of a program in order to understand what it does. You can assume that the program does only what you can see by using strace. To run the program, do the following: Open a linux terminal in an empty directory and perform: wget https://devops-course-sep-22.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/ex1/whatIdo chmod 700 ./whatIdo The wget command is able to retrieve data from the internet. Run the program using strace . Follow strace output. Tip: many lines in the beginning are part of the load of the program. The first \u201cinteresting\u201d lines comes only at the end of the output Your assignment is to supply a brief description of what the program does in the README file Binary Numbers (20 Points) Convert the following binary numbers to a decimals: 111, 100, 10110 What is the available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number? Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent a negative numbers between 0-255 Suggest a method to represent a floating point numbers (e.g. 12.3, 15.67, 0.231) using a 8 bits binary numbers File System Manipulations (60 points) Open a linux terminal and perform: wget https://devops-course-sep-22.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/ex1/secretGenerator.tar.gz Use tar to extract the compressed file. cd to src directory. Explore the files and their content. Your goal is to generate a secret. The secret can be generated using /bin/bash generateSecret.sh . Once you've generated it, copy it to the designated place in the README file (33 characters). Use nano or your preferred text editor, and write a complete commands set that let you to generate the secret in yourSolution.sh file (single command in each line). At the end, given a clean version of src directory (without the changes you've made) you should be able to run /bin/bash yourSolution.sh and the secret should be generated without any errors.
